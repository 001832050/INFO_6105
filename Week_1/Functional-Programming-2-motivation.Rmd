## Motivation
Advantages of FP:

* makes code more compact
* removes duplication
* makes code easy to understand

The "DRY" Principle: "Do not repeat yourself"
```{r motivate, eval = FALSE}
fix_missing <- function(x) {
  x[x == -99] <- NA
  x
}
df[] <- lapply(df, fix_missing)

df[1:5] <- lapply(df[1:5], fix_missing)
```

### Removing duplication
```{r remove_dup}
find_summary <- function(x) {
  funs <- c(mean, median, sd, mad, IQR)
  lapply(funs, function(f) f(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```
